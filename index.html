        <p id="setup">Visual Studio is an IDE which lets you create apps and games using code. In order to set Visual Studio up you need to first check which device you are using. If you are using a Linux/Chromebook, Visual Studio would not work. You will have to use either a MacOS or a Windows in order to be able to use Visual Studio. On Windows, you will need to download Visual Studio by clicking on the "Type to Search" button at the bottom of your screen. Then search up Visual Studio and it will give you an option to download it. In order to download it on MacOS, you will need to download it using App Store. </p>
